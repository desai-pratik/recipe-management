      "instruction": "Great flavour. I doubled the sauce and it was perfect. I used reduced sodium soy and it was not salty. if i didnt have that I would have reduced the soy by about 20% and subbed with water so it wasnt salty. Overall it was a great dish over Jasmine rice. ** just made it again - needs more sauce ! Triple it or add some white wine (1 cup) I also pan fried the chicken in advance. Cut the chicken into bite size pieces. Place 1.5 cups of flour with salt and pepper. Add the chicken pieces and coat using your hands. Remove and add to hot vegetable oil. About 3 minutes per side. Fry in batches so not to overcrowd. When done place on a wire rack in 200 f oven to keep warm. Cook the veggies in the wok as described. Add the sauce when the veggies are ready and now the beauty chicken and mix and serve.",
